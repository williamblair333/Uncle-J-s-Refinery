# ROADMAP — Uncle J's Refinery

Living roadmap. Updated at each session end when items complete or new ones surface.
Completed items age out after ~4 weeks.

---

## In Progress

- **Upstream MemPalace PR #1607** — FTS5 auto-rebuild before abort in `mempalace repair`; 5/6 CI jobs passing (Windows pending); awaiting maintainer review
- **turbovecdb parallel eval** — live as of 2026-06-04 (PR #23 merged); 296K drawers migrated, weekly benchmark + auto-report crons running; awaiting @kostadis response on recall@10 ef tuning

## Planned

- **Compressed `jcodemunch_guide` return value** — offline compress `_generate_claude_md_snippet()` output via cheap model; benchmark 20 representative routing queries before/after; ~4,600–5,100 tokens/session savings at full tier; upstream contribution to jcodemunch

- **ralph-harness env-strip (after 2026-06-15)** — strip `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` + `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` from subprocess env in `ralph-harness.sh` and Telegram gateway; enables Agent SDK credit billing ($0 actual cost within monthly credit); do NOT apply before June 15

- **Submit upstream MemPalace HNSW flush fix** — review `state/upstream-bug-report-hnsw-flush.md` + `state/upstream-pr-hnsw-flush.md`, submit to https://github.com/MemPalace/mempalace; once merged, remove force-flush Step 2b from `mempalace-repair-now.sh` and unpin `chromadb==1.5.8`

- **Telegram chat history persistence** — skill exists (`telegram-chat-history-persistence`)
  but implementation not yet started; would allow querying past bot conversations

- **Agent harness competitive analysis** — skill exists; full analysis not yet run

- **ECC specialist agents** — 6 agents imported; evaluate and integrate into
  active workflows

- **Expand discipline hook surface list** — after 1 week of `hook-blocks.log` data, review BLOCKED patterns and expand `edit-surface-guard.sh` surface list if coverage gaps appear; narrow if false positives are high
