# ROADMAP — Uncle J's Refinery

Living roadmap. Updated at each session end when items complete or new ones surface.
Completed items age out after ~4 weeks.

## In Progress

- **memweave migration — final residue (2026-06-13):** mempalace fully decommissioned in-repo
  (PRs #50–#55). Remaining = items I cannot do / shouldn't rush: global `~/.claude/` edits
  (harness-denied — `!`-command provided), the `pre-mortem`/`post-audit-mempalace-capture`
  audit-sink repoint (control-invariant — wants a red-team-reviewed pass), and purging the staged
  trash dirs (2.4 G + 55 G, irreversible — Bill's call). See HANDOFF + `project_memweave-migration-done`.
- *(obsolete — mempalace gone)* ~~Upstream MemPalace PR #1607~~ / ~~turbovecdb parallel eval~~ —
  both were mempalace/palace-coupled; dropped with the decommission.

## Planned

**Improvement Program** (spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-11-refinery-improvement-program-design.md` — phases in order; principles: deterministic-first, local-canonical):

- **Phase 2 — Accuracy instrumentation → memweave migration** ✅ **DONE 2026-06-13** (see Completed). Backend decision (MemPalace eliminated → memweave) resolved 2026-06-12; memweave built (PRs #45–#48) and the full migration + mempalace decommission shipped (PRs #50–#55).
- **Phase 3 — Local rail** — Ollama endpoint + hardware-detect model select (Qwen3-Coder 30B / Devstral 24B / Qwen3 8B tiers); batch pipelines local-first (mine compression w/ content-hash caching, dream synthesis, guide compression); dreaming now promotes into the memweave store; pattern-importance scoring as pure script
- **Phase 4 — Subtraction & absorption** — signed-off deletions (Bill, 2026-06-11): ~~D1 stale palace copies (55GB)~~ executed 2026-06-11; ~~**D2** ChromaDB repair apparatus~~ **DONE 2026-06-13** (mempalace fully decommissioned, PRs #50–#55); **D3** ralph — only if Phase 2 usage counter confirms idle. Plus: CLAUDE.md de-dup (project stub, ~4k tokens/session); absorption check added to `post-upgrade-mcp-integration` (script-diff Claude Code changelog vs harness-layer manifest)

- **Compressed `jcodemunch_guide` return value** — offline compress `_generate_claude_md_snippet()` output via cheap model (Phase 3 local rail candidate); benchmark 20 representative routing queries before/after; ~4,600–5,100 tokens/session savings at full tier; upstream contribution to jcodemunch

- **ralph-harness env-strip (after 2026-06-15)** — strip `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` + `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` from subprocess env in `ralph-harness.sh` and Telegram gateway; enables Agent SDK credit billing ($0 actual cost within monthly credit); do NOT apply before June 15

- **Telegram chat history persistence** — skill exists (`telegram-chat-history-persistence`)
  but implementation not yet started; would allow querying past bot conversations

- **Agent harness competitive analysis** — skill exists; full analysis not yet run

- **ECC specialist agents** — 6 agents imported; evaluate and integrate into
  active workflows

- **Expand discipline hook surface list** — after 1 week of `hook-blocks.log` data, review BLOCKED patterns and expand `edit-surface-guard.sh` surface list if coverage gaps appear; narrow if false positives are high

| 2026-05-26 | `SessionStart` git fetch hook — async `git fetch --quiet` wired in `~/.claude/settings.json`; remote tracking state no longer stale at session open |
