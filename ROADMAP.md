# ROADMAP — Uncle J's Refinery

Living roadmap. Updated at each session end when items complete or new ones surface.
Completed items age out after ~4 weeks.

---

## In Progress

- **Upstream MemPalace PR #1607** — FTS5 auto-rebuild before abort in `mempalace repair`; 5/6 CI jobs passing (Windows pending); awaiting maintainer review

---

## Planned

- **CI test job for `session-end-check.sh`** — add a pytest step to
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml` now that the test file exists

- **Telegram chat history persistence** — skill exists (`telegram-chat-history-persistence`)
  but implementation not yet started; would allow querying past bot conversations

- **Agent harness competitive analysis** — skill exists; full analysis not yet run

- **ECC specialist agents** — 6 agents imported; evaluate and integrate into
  active workflows

- **Expand discipline hook surface list** — after 1 week of `hook-blocks.log` data, review BLOCKED patterns and expand `edit-surface-guard.sh` surface list if coverage gaps appear; narrow if false positives are high

## Completed (recent)

| Date | Item |
|------|------|
| 2026-06-03 | Dict-pickle root cause closed — verified `_persist()` is sole `pickle.dump` in chromadb; dict can't recur via any normal op; Step 2b (dead WAL commit, failed every run) removed from repair script; Step 2c comment corrected |
| 2026-06-03 | MemPalace dict-format pickle detection hardened — `healthcheck.sh` now probes pickle type (BAD:/ERR: discrimination, traceback-safe); `mempalace-repair-now.sh` Step 2c auto-migrates dict→SimpleNamespace after every repair; three code-review bugs fixed |
| 2026-06-03 | SQLite WAL data race bug fixed — upgraded to 3.51.3 via pysqlite3 source build; `.pth` patch covers all venv processes; install.sh step 2b auto-rebuilds on fresh machines; scan-commit.sh lockfile exemption fixed |
| 2026-06-03 | FTS5 corruption root cause eliminated — disabled `fts5-guard.sh` (concurrent B-tree corruptor), fixed `session-start-autofix.sh` to use venv Python + PRAGMA quick_check + flock, fixed healthcheck false-ok (was using FTS5 integrity-check), fixed `install_cron()` prefix matching, deduplicated 6 crontab entries; HEALTHCHECK: ok |
| 2026-05-28 | Review-queue triage workflow — `review-queue-triage` skill in regular session rhythm; `_review/` cleared |
| 2026-05-28 | Telegram multi-agent routing — `/work <msg>` dispatches to project-context Claude (CLAUDE.md loaded); default stays restricted; `config/telegram-agents.toml` config; hardcoded fallback on missing/malformed TOML; PR #20 |
| 2026-05-28 | MemPalace HNSW nightly destruction fixed — three-bug root cause: missing `--skip-if-healthy`, WAL never committed to HNSW, post-repair check SQLite-only; PR #19 |
| 2026-05-27 | `install-reliability.sh` plugin auto-install — superpowers + ralph-wiggum at user scope; `skill-link.sh` Stop hook no longer unlinks global-skills |
| 2026-05-27 | FTS5 guard + repair/mine coordination + skill-link blocking fix; `features/mempalace/install.sh` cron coordination; PR #14 |
| 2026-05-26 | `scripts/refinery-doctor.sh` — config drift detection + repair; 4 checks: embed-model, jcodemunch-scope, claude-md-sync, env-placeholders; atomic `--fix`; PR #13 |
| 2026-05-26 | `skill-link.sh` walks `global-skills/` — all globally promoted skills now auto-symlink on every session open; no manual `install-reliability.sh` needed after `git pull` |
| 2026-05-26 | 5 machine-local skills promoted to global — `pre-mortem`, `healthcheck-interactive-hints`, `mempalace-boot-repair-always-runs`, `platform-removal-cleanup`, `stop-hook-dedup-guard` |
