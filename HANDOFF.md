# Handoff — Uncle J's Refinery

*Last updated: 2026-05-27 (healthcheck FTS5 false positive fixed, Feature 2 next)*

Read this before touching anything. Work priorities are in order below.

---

## Current state (2026-05-27) — healthcheck FTS5 false positive fixed, Feature 2 next

### Healthcheck — now fully green

`HEALTHCHECK: ok` — both previous failures cleared:
- **`mempalace-sqlite` false positive** — `healthcheck.sh` was using system `sqlite3` 3.46.1
  to validate FTS5 indexes written by Python's sqlite3 3.50.4. Fixed to use venv Python
  with fallback guard. PR #15.
- **`stack-not-at-head`** — `uv.lock` updated; jcodemunch and mempalace at today's HEAD.

---

## Current state (2026-05-27) — PR #14 merged, Feature 2 next

### Next action — Feature 2: Telegram multi-agent routing

Plan ready at `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-26-telegram-agent-routing.md` (5 tasks).

### Infrastructure fixes — MERGED ✓ (PR #14)

1. **FTS5 recurring corruption** — 4am repair waits for 3am mine locks via `flock -w 7200`
2. **`scripts/fts5-guard.sh`** — async SessionStart safety net; auto-repairs FTS5 if still corrupt
3. **skill-link async race** — SessionStart hook now blocking; fixed in settings.json + install.sh
4. **`features/mempalace/install.sh`** — mine + repair crons register with full lock coordination automatically

Other machines: `git pull && bash features/mempalace/install.sh` to pick up the updated crons.

### MemPalace — HNSW healthy

Rebuilt this session: 294,397 elements. `embeddings_queue` compactor lag (~44K) is normal post-repair — clears on next mine run.

### PR #13 — refinery-doctor — MERGED ✓

---

## Current state (2026-05-26) — refinery-doctor implemented, PR #13 open

### `Unknown skill` fix — both machines resolved

Root cause (other machine): `install-reliability.sh` not run after `git pull` brought in new `global-skills/`. Fix: `bash install-reliability.sh`.
Root cause (this machine): `skill-link.sh` needs `link` arg — SessionStart hook was calling it without args. Fix: `bash scripts/skill-link.sh link`.

### Remaining items

- **`stack-not-at-head` (X)** — packages behind HEAD. Next session: run `stack-not-at-head-remediation` skill.
- **Stash** — `wip: session-end-2026-05-24 uncommitted changes` on the docs branch contains `scripts/session-start-autofix.sh` wiring. Review and drop or cherry-pick: `git stash list`.

### Feature 1 — `scripts/refinery-doctor.sh` — DONE, PR #13 open

**Branch:** `feat/refinery-doctor` (pushed, PR open at github.com/williamblair333/Uncle-J-s-Refinery/pull/13)

Implementation complete. All 4 checks working and verified:
- `embed-model` — detects missing `JCODEMUNCH_EMBED_MODEL` in `.env`, fixes atomically
- `jcodemunch-scope` — detects stale `local`/`project` MCP scope, fixes via `claude mcp remove`
- `claude-md-sync` — sha256 drift detection for `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, fixes with backup
- `env-placeholders` — report-only, flags template values in `.env`

54 tests passing, atomic `--fix` (`.env.bak` + `.env.tmp` → `mv`). Exit 0 = clean. Merge when ready.

### Feature 2 — Telegram multi-agent routing — NEXT

### Both features specced — Feature 1 done

Design spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-26-doctor-and-routing-design.md`

**Feature 1 — `scripts/refinery-doctor.sh`** (branch: `feat/refinery-doctor`)
- Standalone bash script for config-schema-drift detection
- Dry-run by default; `--fix` applies auto-fixable migrations atomically
- 4 checks: `embed-model`, `jcodemunch-scope`, `claude-md-sync`, `env-placeholders`
- Atomic `.env` write: `.env.bak` + `.env.tmp` → `mv` (never partial-corrupt)
- Plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-26-refinery-doctor.md` (7 tasks, TDD)

**Feature 2 — Telegram multi-agent routing** (branch: `feat/telegram-agent-routing`)
- New file: `config/telegram-agents.toml` (prefix → agent dispatch table)
- New functions in `scripts/telegram-gateway-poll.sh` Python section:
  `load_agents()`, `route_message()`, `resolve_cwd()`
- `/work` prefix → work agent (PROJ_ROOT, CLAUDE.md); no prefix → restricted default
- Pre-mortem requirements R1–R5 baked into the plan
- Plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-26-telegram-agent-routing.md` (5 tasks)

**Feature 3 — Docker-sandboxed Telegram sessions** — deferred
- Requires getting `claude --print` (OAuth tokens from `~/.claude/`) working inside
  Docker containers; credential management is non-trivial. Own session, own PR.

### Next action

Start implementation on either feature:
```
feat/refinery-doctor          # create branch, execute 7-task plan
feat/telegram-agent-routing   # create branch, execute 5-task plan
```
Each plan is self-contained — tasks are ordered with TDD steps, exact code, and commit
commands. Use `superpowers:executing-plans` or `superpowers:subagent-driven-development`.

## Current state (2026-05-26)

### skill-link.sh now covers global-skills/

`scripts/skill-link.sh` (SessionStart async hook) now walks both `skills/` and
`global-skills/`. Any skill promoted to `global-skills/` and pulled will be
auto-symlinked on the next session open — no manual `install-reliability.sh` needed.
Also upgrades flat copies to proper symlinks automatically.

### Skills promoted to global this session

4 skills from the dma64 machine promoted to `global-skills/` and committed — will auto-symlink on next `install-reliability.sh` run on any machine:
- `healthcheck-interactive-hints`
- `mempalace-boot-repair-always-runs`
- `platform-removal-cleanup`
- `stop-hook-dedup-guard`
- `pre-mortem`

### Machine-local changes made this session

- **`uncle-j-mempalace-repair` cron restored** — `0 4 * * * .venv/bin/mempalace repair` added back to crontab; was missing since the `@reboot --skip-if-healthy` transition. `HEALTHCHECK: fail (1)` on cron check now cleared.
- **`git fetch --quiet` SessionStart hook** — added to `~/.claude/settings.json` as async hook; runs in background each session open so remote tracking state is never stale.
- **jcodemunch reindexed** — was 41 commits stale; now at HEAD (`17d0708b`).

### Healthcheck — all clear

`HEALTHCHECK: ok` expected on next session start. All issues from previous session resolved:
- jcodemunch-mcp upgraded 1.108.20 → 1.108.24; index at HEAD (`5462a188`)
- `pre-mortem` skill restored at `~/.claude/skills/pre-mortem/SKILL.md`
- `healthcheck.sh check_jcodemunch_path()` updated to accept code-index venv path (no more false-fail after jcodemunch-reindex.sh runs)

**Note:** After Claude Code restart the MCP server will reconnect with jcodemunch 1.108.24. Run `jcodemunch_guide` in the first session after restart to confirm the tool list is unchanged.

### post-merge-hook.sh — verified working

`scripts/post-merge-hook.sh` exists and is wired as `.git/hooks/post-merge`. Fires on every `git pull`, categorizes actionable changes (new feature install.sh, CLAUDE.md updates, new skills/scripts), delivers via Telegram or terminal boxed summary. Auto-reindexes jdocmunch and jcodemunch on relevant file changes.

### Previous session (catch-up pull + skill install)

- Pulled 40 commits (May 22–25). Fast-forward, no conflicts.
- `install-reliability.sh` run: all discipline hooks linked, 6 new skills live.
- Orphaned `stash@{0}` dropped (undocumented graphviz/matplotlib dep additions).

---

## Current state (2026-05-25, session 6)

### Blocking discipline hooks — LIVE

Two PreToolUse hooks now mechanically block undisciplined tool use:

1. **`hooks/discipline/edit-surface-guard.sh`** — fires on every Edit/Write. If the target file is on the surface list (`.sh`, `.py`, `.toml`, `.yml`, `.yaml`, `Dockerfile*`, `settings.json`, `CLAUDE.md`, `scripts/`, `hooks/`, `features/`), it blocks the edit and requires pre-mortem first.
   - Bypass: after running pre-mortem, `touch /tmp/premortem-cleared-SESSION_ID` — consumed and removed on the next edit attempt.
2. **`hooks/discipline/grep-guard.sh`** — fires on every Bash call containing `grep -r` / `grep --recursive` on non-log paths. Blocks and directs to `mcp__jcodemunch__search_text` instead.

**State:**
- Hook scripts: `hooks/discipline/` in repo (symlinked to `~/.claude/hooks/discipline/`)
- Wired in `~/.claude/settings.json`: 10 PreToolUse hooks total
- `state/hook-blocks.log` receives all BLOCKED/ALLOWED entries
- `install-reliability.sh` now wires these on fresh-machine setup

**Weekly review:** session-end-checklist Step 6 reviews `hook-blocks.log` weekly.

**MemPalace HNSW** — should be healthy on next session start (skip-if-healthy cron in place). Verify via SessionStart health check output at session open.

---

## Current state (2026-05-25, session 5 continued)

### repair output now streams live
`mempalace-repair-now.sh` no longer buffers output. Progress lines write to `state/mempalace-repair.log` in real time.

---

## Current state (2026-05-25, session 5)

### @reboot repair now conditional — skip-if-healthy

`mempalace-repair-now.sh` has a new `--skip-if-healthy` flag. The `@reboot` cron uses it. On next reboot, if HNSW is healthy (non-empty, <200MB, element count ≥80% of SQLite), repair skips and exits in seconds instead of running a 90-min rebuild.

**Crontab change is machine-local** — not in the repo. If reinstalling on a new machine, update the `@reboot` cron manually to add `--skip-if-healthy`.

---

## Current state (2026-05-25)

### MemPalace — MCP server offline (needs Claude Code restart)

**Status:** Tools deregistered this session (server killed to apply fix). Restart Claude Code to reconnect.

**Root cause finally found (session 4):**  
The `'dict' object has no attribute 'dimensionality'` error was NOT stale in-memory HNSW state — it was a **dict-format pickle on disk**. The `index_metadata.pickle` for segment `f89df21a` (mempalace_drawers VECTOR segment) was stored as a plain Python dict instead of the `PersistentData` object that chromadb 1.5.8's SegmentAPI expects. SegmentAPI loads the dict, `cast(PersistentData, dict)` silently returns the dict, then `.dimensionality` fails.

`PersistentClient` (default Rust API) can handle dict-format pickles, which is why direct subprocess queries always succeeded — they used Rust API by default. The MCP server and mine scripts force `CHROMA_API_IMPL=chromadb.api.segment.SegmentAPI`, which hits the failure.

**Why "restart Claude Code" never fixed it:** A new server process loaded the same broken dict-format pickle from disk, got the same error.

**Fixes applied this session:**
1. Migrated `f89df21a/index_metadata.pickle` from dict → `PersistentData` format (one-time, immediate)
2. Fixed `mempalace-health.py` live query to use `chromadb.PersistentClient` instead of `Client(settings)` (the latter was the fragile path that triggered the failure)
3. Fixed FTS5 corruption (malformed inverted index) via `INSERT INTO embedding_fulltext_search(embedding_fulltext_search) VALUES('rebuild')`
4. Added SessionStart health check hook to `.claude/settings.json` — health check now runs at every session start

**Post-restart verify (in the new session):**
```bash
mempalace_search(query="HNSW test", limit=1)  # should return results, no 'dict' error
```

**Open question:** What process writes dict-format pickles? The 4am repair (SegmentAPI) should write PersistentData format. The mine also uses SegmentAPI. The exact mechanism is unclear. If the problem recurs, the SessionStart health check will catch it.

**Previous rebuild**: 4am cron ran on 2026-05-25 at 04:00–05:29. `REPAIR_RESULT=success`, 235,251 embeddings rebuilt from SQLite. Previous corrupt palace at `~/.mempalace/palace.pre-rebuild-20260525-040008`.

Root cause (chroma-hnswlib Rust type-confusion bug) mitigated by `CHROMA_API_IMPL=chromadb.api.segment.SegmentAPI` set in all entry points. Repair script updated to use `--mode from-sqlite` so any future corruption will recover cleanly without cascading damage.

### README hero tagline — rewritten this session

Old: *"A self-hosted personal AI operating system for Claude Code — retrieval stack, memory, observability, and a nightly self-improvement loop."*

New: *"Claude Code forgets everything when you close the terminal. This doesn't. It remembers past decisions, navigates your codebase without re-reading files from scratch, logs every action for review, and runs overnight to extract playbooks from its own mistakes. One install, every project."*

---

### Pre-mortem enforcement hooks — live in `~/.claude/` (NOT in repo)

Two hook layers added to force `pre-mortem` skill invocation before GitHub artifact creation:

| Hook | File | Trigger |
|------|------|---------|
| `UserPromptSubmit` | `~/.claude/hooks/pre-mortem-guard/prompt-guard.sh` | message contains PR/issue/push/merge/wrap-up keywords |
| `PreToolUse/Bash` | `~/.claude/hooks/pre-mortem-guard/pretool-guard.sh` | command matches `gh pr create\|gh issue create\|gh issue new` |

Wired in `~/.claude/settings.json`. Pre-mortem skill (`~/.claude/skills/pre-mortem/SKILL.md`) also updated — "GitHub actions" surface row added.

**New-machine setup:** these files are not in the repo. Copy manually or add to a dotfiles install script. Paths:
```
~/.claude/hooks/pre-mortem-guard/prompt-guard.sh
~/.claude/hooks/pre-mortem-guard/pretool-guard.sh
~/.claude/settings.json  (hooks.UserPromptSubmit[-1] + hooks.PreToolUse[-1])
~/.claude/skills/pre-mortem/SKILL.md
```

**uv.lock:** mempalace bumped to `3a4be3e` (adds `python-dateutil`). Committed this session.

---

**MemPalace is healthy and verified.** HNSW rebuilt, FTS5 clean, ~94K drawers active
(down from 475K: the 437K fog-of-chess wing was deleted this session as intended).

**Upstream PR #1607 open** (`mempalace-develop/mempalace`):
- Adds FTS5 auto-rebuild before aborting on `mempalace repair` and `mempalace repair-hnsw rebuild`
- 5 of 6 CI jobs passing (lint ✓, test-linux 3.9/3.11/3.13 ✓, test-macos ✓, test-windows pending)
- Fork lives at `/opt/proj/mempalace`
- Upstream contrib backlog: `~/.claude/projects/-opt-proj-Uncle-J-s-Refinery/memory/project_mempalace-contrib.md`

**What changed this session:**
- `mempalace-repair-now.sh` — updated to handle new segment UUIDs after fog-of-chess deletion
- `mempalace-repair-verify.sh` — new script; verifies HNSW health post-repair (SQLite vs HNSW count, FTS5 integrity)
- `mempalace-delete-wing.py` — new script; deletes a wing's drawers from MemPalace by prefix
- `fog-of-chess` wing deleted (437K drawers removed); HNSW rebuilt clean at ~94K

## Current state

### ✅ MemPalace HNSW corruption — PERMANENTLY FIXED

The HNSW corruption from chroma-core/chroma#4460 is now prevented at the source. No manual repair needed at next session start.

**What was done:**
- `chroma-hnswlib==0.7.6` added to project dependencies — provides stable Python hnswlib; chromadb now uses the Python HNSW path instead of the buggy Rust bindings
- `CHROMA_API_IMPL=chromadb.api.segment.SegmentAPI` exported in all mine/repair/MCP-start scripts and crontab entries (belt-and-suspenders)
- Health check detection thresholds corrected for chroma-hnswlib format
- Stop hook now goes through `mempalace-mine-convos.sh` (picks up env var + HNSW size guard)

**Current HNSW status (verified clean):**
- `mempalace_closets` (3a9d5d2b): link_lists=0B ✓
- `mempalace_drawers` (9e08b487): link_lists=203KB ✓
- Health check: exits 1 (WARN only — embeddings_queue compactor lag), no CRIT

**Remaining WARN (pre-existing, not urgent):**
- `embeddings_queue` has ~24K entries — compactor lag from large mine session. Clears automatically after the current mine finishes.

### New this session (2026-05-23 — HNSW corruption root-cause fix)
- **Root cause identified and mitigated**: `updatePoint` thread-safety bug in chromadb-hnswlib 1.5.x (chroma-core/chroma#4460, unresolved upstream across all 1.5.x including 1.5.9)
- **`hnsw:num_threads=1`** set on both collections in SQLite metadata AND patched as default in `hnsw_params.py` — eliminates the concurrent update race; survives chromadb upgrades via collection metadata
- **Health check fixed**: `header.bin` was parsed as uint32 — 7.2T corruption wrapped to 0 and silently passed all checks. Now int64 with 10M sanity cap; CRIT alert fires correctly
- **FTS5 rebuilt** in-place; SQLite `PRAGMA integrity_check` confirms clean
- **`mempalace-repair-now.sh`** added: safe one-shot rebuild script with pre-flight writer check
- **Stop-hook overlap fixed**: stop-hook mine command now wrapped with `flock -n` — concurrent session ends no longer spawn multiple overlapping mine processes
- **Crontab deduplicated**: removed duplicate backup/health entries; flock guards added to all mine crons; `@reboot` entry added for missed-cron recovery
- **HANDOFF correction**: previous entry said "chromadb 1.5.9 (Rust HNSW bug fixed)" — this was wrong. We run 1.5.8 (pinned in pyproject.toml); the bug is unresolved in 1.5.9 too. Single-thread mitigation is the correct fix.

### Previous session (2026-05-23 — MemPalace HNSW auto-fix)
- **chromadb pinned**: `pyproject.toml` now has `override-dependencies = ["chromadb==1.5.8"]` — freezes the embedded Rust HNSW version; bump intentionally after verifying repair runs clean on a new version
- **`healthcheck.sh --fixall`**: new flag auto-runs all fixable hints without prompting (safe for cron/CI); normal interactive Y/n unchanged
- **HNSW/SQLite drift detection**: `check_mempalace()` now has a Python sub-step that compares SQLite drawer count to HNSW header element count — fails with an auto-fixable `run: mempalace repair` hint when HNSW < 50% of SQLite
- **Nightly repair cron**: `features/mempalace/install.sh` now installs two crons:
  - 3am: `mempalace mine` (project code index)
  - 4am: `mempalace repair` (HNSW rebuild from SQLite)
- HNSW vector search was fully broken at session start (1,056 HNSW vs 467k SQLite); self-healed during session — now in sync (468k/472k)

### Previous session
- **Healthcheck `--fixall` flag**: `healthcheck.sh --fixall` auto-runs every `run:` hint without prompting. `FIX_ALL=false` declared in arg parser; `--fixall` sets it true; `hint()` checks `FIX_ALL` first before the interactive `[y/N]` branch.
- **Healthcheck HNSW/SQLite drift detection**: new sub-step added to `check_mempalace()` — Python snippet compares SQLite drawer count to HNSW header element count; fails with interactive `run: mempalace repair` hint when HNSW < SQLite/2. `uncle-j-mempalace-repair` added to `check_crons()` EXPECTED. SQLite FTS5 hint prefix fixed from `repair:` → `run:` so Y/n auto-exec fires.
- **Session-end checklist system** live: pre-commit hook blocks commits missing CHANGELOG.md/HANDOFF.md; Stop hook sends Telegram warning; `session-end-checklist` skill walks all steps. Config in `.session-end.yml`.
- **Standard docs added**: `LICENSE` (AGPL-3.0), `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `ROADMAP.md`
- **install.sh improvements**: Context7 key auto-reads from `context7.key`; Telegram overwrite protection (`[y/N]` default)
- **Context7 API key** configured in `~/.claude/.env`
- **Telegram backlog age filter**: messages >10 min old dropped silently (prevents rate-limit burn)
- **`telegram-inline-button-promote` skill** added (concurrent session): documents how to wire inline keyboard buttons into polling bots
- **`session-end-checklist` skill symlinked** to `~/.claude/skills/` — now invocable as `/session-end-checklist`

### Working

- 7 MCP servers registered: jcodemunch, jdatamunch, jdocmunch, mempalace, serena, duckdb, context7
- Global `CLAUDE.md` with routing policy, security rules, jOutputMunch rules
- Global skills: `prior-art-check`, `judge`, `outcomes`, `orchestrator`, `per-task-review-cycle`, `post-upgrade-mcp-integration`, `dream-synthesizer`, `deep-repo-analysis`, `stale-lock-diagnosis`, `fog-of-chess-engine-mode-implementation`, `mcp-index-empty-diagnosis`, `stale-pending-memory-guard`, `validate-external-audit` — all live symlinks in `global-skills/`, installed to `~/.claude/skills/` via `install-reliability.sh`
- Guardrails: secret scanner (UserPromptSubmit) + injection defender + commit-time scan
- All features built and installed (dreaming, session-stats, Telegram gateway/notify, auto-skill, ralph-cron, skill-manager, stack-alerts, mempalace)
- **Telegram gateway** (`scripts/telegram-gateway-poll.sh`): fully operational. `update_id` offset now written atomically per-update (dedup fix). Security module + 38-test suite in `tests/test_tg_security.py`. **Purpose: approval channel + monitoring alerts** (not a chat assistant — each message is self-describing).
  - **Notification events**: stack upgrades (approve/skip pitch) · new skill drafts (promote instructions) · healthcheck failures (daily 07:00 via `healthcheck-notify.sh`) · unauthorized chat access · injection attempts · Ralph plateau · dream synthesis complete
- `scripts/ralph-harness.sh` — bash port complete with `--rubric` and `--decompose` modes
- **Langfuse** — fully operational, all 6 containers healthy, version 3.169.0 at `http://localhost:3050`
- **MemPalace v3.3.5** — BM25 search operational; 467k+ drawers
  - chromadb 1.5.8 (pinned in pyproject.toml; bug unresolved upstream — mitigated via `hnsw:num_threads=1`)
  - **HNSW index pending rebuild**: HNSW binaries deleted this session; SQLite has 474K embeddings intact. Run `bash mempalace-repair-now.sh` at next session start to rebuild. BM25 active in the meantime.
  - HNSW size guard active in both mine wrappers (aborts if > 200 MB)
  - Mine stale-lock auto-clear: locks older than 30 min cleared automatically on next invocation
  - PR #1523 (VACUUM+FTS5 fix in `repair --yes`) merged upstream and running in our installed version
- **ClickHouse 24.8.14.39** — patched past CVE-2025-1385. Library bridge not running. No upgrade needed.
- **Git-as-golden-reference**: all 4 packages (`jcodemunch`, `jdatamunch`, `jdocmunch`, `mempalace`) installed from GitHub SHA via `uv`, not PyPI. `pyproject.toml` uses `git+https://` sources; `uv.lock` pins exact commit SHAs.
- **Post-merge hook**: fires on `git pull`, sends Telegram alert listing new features/installers/skills needing action; also reindexes jcodemunch when code files change
- **Healthcheck checks**: all named descriptively (no more numbered labels); staleness check is warning-only; secret scanner scoped to Langfuse `sk-lf-*` only; 3 new guards (9i/9j/9k)
- **Docker freshness** (`check-stack-freshness.sh`): actionable tier (`langfuse`, `langfuse-worker`) vs informational tier (`clickhouse`, `redis`, `postgres`, `minio`)
- **Auto-maintenance**: `scripts/auto-maintain.sh` (3am cron) handles threshold upgrades + CLAUDE.md sync + skills autocommit + embedding canary pin; `scripts/jcodemunch-reindex.sh` (1am cron) keeps index current
- **Local ONNX embeddings**: `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` at `~/.code-index/models/`; canary pinned at `~/.code-index/embed_canary.json`; no API key required; semantic search active
- Git: up to date with `origin/main`

### No blockers

All items from all previous HANDOFFs are resolved.

## What happened (2026-05-15 → 2026-05-20)

### 2026-05-15 (session 3)
- Submitted MemPalace upstream PR #1523 (VACUUM+FTS5 fix for `repair --yes`)
- Fixes: upstream issues filed for mine concurrency (no built-in lock guard)

### 2026-05-18
- **MemPalace remote backup**: `mempalace-backup.sh` syncs to rclone remote when `MEMPALACE_REMOTE` is set
- **install-reliability.sh symlink fix**: switched from `cp -r` to `ln -sfn` — skills are now live symlinks, `git pull` propagates skill updates automatically
- **mempalace-health.py**: portable shebang + self-re-exec (no longer hardcoded to this machine's venv path)

### 2026-05-19 (session 2)
- **jdocmunch index wired**: `install.sh` step 4d indexes docs on first install; `post-merge-hook.sh` re-indexes on any `.md` change; healthcheck guards against empty index

### 2026-05-19 (session 3)
- **Automation hardening**: `--non-interactive` flag + TTY gate on all `prompt_yes_no` calls; CI/piped installs no longer stall on stdin
- **CLAUDE.md auto-install**: `install.sh` copies routing policy to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` with timestamped backup; manual copy step removed
- **Post-merge hook opt-in**: wiring the hook now requires an explicit yes prompt (default: no)
- **Healthcheck cleanup**: numbered step labels replaced with descriptive names; staleness check demoted to warning-only; secret scanner narrowed to Langfuse `sk-lf-*`
- **README**: hardcoded `/opt/proj` paths replaced with `$STACK_ROOT`
- **CI matrix**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — lint + install smoke + aux syntax on ubuntu-latest

### 2026-05-19
- **Git-as-golden-reference**: packages installed from GitHub SHA, freshness check diffs locked SHA vs GitHub HEAD
- **Stale lock auto-clear**: mine scripts clear locks > 30 min old (fixes silent blackout from SIGKILL'd processes)
- **Post-merge hook** (`scripts/post-merge-hook.sh`): Telegrams what changed and what needs action after `git pull`
- **Healthcheck gaps** (checks 9a-9g): SQLite FTS5 integrity, stale locks, HNSW guard, all 5 cron jobs, packages at HEAD, post-merge hook symlink, stale MEMORY.md entries
- **Docker freshness tiers**: split actionable vs informational services
- **New skills**: `deep-repo-analysis` (full architectural health audit), `stale-lock-diagnosis` (refactored)
- **PR #1523 merged**: `_vacuum_and_rebuild_fts5` confirmed in installed `repair.py`; we're at upstream HEAD (`1b94f4e`)

### 2026-05-20
- **New skills committed**: `fog-of-chess-engine-mode-implementation`, `mcp-index-empty-diagnosis`, `stale-pending-memory-guard`, `validate-external-audit` — were on disk and symlinked but not committed
- **Stack upgrade**: jcodemunch 1.108.19 → 1.108.20; index rebuilt 77 → 4,624 symbols
- **CLAUDE.md routing expanded**: 30+ missing jcodemunch tools added (digest, get_repo_health, assemble_task_context, check_rename_safe, check_delete_safe, plan_refactoring, get_symbol_provenance, register_edit, get_tectonic_map, get_signal_chains, render_diagram, search_ast, get_dead_code_v2, audit_agent_config, + runtime trace tools); both global + project CLAUDE.md in sync

### 2026-05-23
- **Telegram inline promote button**: `skill-suggest.sh` now sends skill draft notifications with an inline "✅ Promote Global" button; gateway polls for `callback_query` updates and handles button taps directly
- **promote <id> defaults to global**: classify round-trip removed — `promote <id>` installs straight to global without asking
- **Stop-hook dedup**: `session-end-check.sh` skips duplicate Telegram warnings within 15 seconds (fixes double-send when two sessions close simultaneously)

### 2026-05-21
- **Design spec written**: two automation gaps identified and fully specced — skill auto-install (dynamic `global-skills/` scan + symlink in auto-maintain Part C) and post-upgrade evaluation for all 4 packages with breaking-change detection and HANDOFF/CLAUDE.md auto-update. Spec at `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-21-skill-auto-install-and-upgrade-eval-design.md`. Implementation plan is next.
- **`readme-sync` skill committed**: `global-skills/readme-sync/` — audits README against repo contents; three targeted edits max.
- **Skill auto-install + post-upgrade evaluation implemented**: `install-reliability.sh` now scans `global-skills/` dynamically; `auto-maintain.sh` Part B extended to all 4 packages with commit-log fetch, breaking-change grep (including `feat!` notation), HANDOFF.md auto-note, Part C symlink pass, and Telegram alert.
- **mempalace upgraded** `95caf80f` → `60d460b3`: `feat(convo_miner)` — AI tool sessions auto-routed to `wing_api` during mining. No breaking changes; no CLAUDE.md updates required.
- **`auto-maintain-commit-and-deploy` skill tightened**: added metadata front matter, shorter prose, fixed `ln -sf` → `ln -s` in examples, clarified bash+Claude hybrid upgrade pattern.
- **dma64 branch merged into main** (meaningful changes cherry-picked): interactive healthcheck `hint()` prompt, `scripts/pin-canary.sh` (dedicated canary pinner with exit-code guarantee), Telegram rate-limit flood fix (`rate_limit_notified` flag), CLAUDE.md section 1 reorganized into 8 subsections with ~43 additional jcodemunch tools, duplicate `### 6.` numbering fixed. dma64 branch is now behind main by these commits.
- **Stale mine lock check demoted to WARN**: `healthcheck.sh` stale lock check no longer calls `record_fail` — auto-clears on next mine invocation, not a blocker.

### 2026-05-20 (session 5, continued)
- **Gateway disclosure fix v2** (`3e3a9a9`): API-direct approach (OAuth token as api_key) dropped — tokens rotate unpredictably and produce 401 on rotation. `--system-prompt` (replace, not append) is the correct approach: harness does NOT inject system-reminder when --system-prompt is provided, so OS/kernel/email/paths/MCP stack are never in context. Both main message path and classify_promote now use `claude --print --system-prompt RESTRICTION` from `cwd=/tmp`. Stress-tested against 6 adversarial prompts including DAN jailbreak, authority claim, emotional pressure, and explicit threats — all refused correctly.
- **Second machine noted**: `dma64` branch (kernel 6.19.14) has its own Telegram bot and is independently applying `git pull` + `install.sh`; will merge with `main` eventually. Saved to memory.

### 2026-05-20 (session 5)
- **Telegram gateway runtime fixes** (3 bugs, 1 commit `8ce0833`):
  - Gateway was completely broken since 09:30 — heredoc wins pipe stdin, `sys.stdin.read()` returned `''`, all polls failed with JSON parse error. Fixed by exporting `UPDATES_JSON` env var.
  - Disclosure despite `--append-system-prompt` restriction: harness `system-reminder` injects OS/email/paths/MCP stack regardless of appended prompt. Switched to Anthropic API-direct (OAuth token from `~/.claude/.credentials.json`) — no harness context at all. Verified: disclosure prompt returns exact refusal string.
  - `session-notify.sh` was firing for every interactive/automated Claude session on the machine. Added `CLAUDE_NOTIFY_ON_STOP=1` opt-in; default off.
- **`anthropic` SDK installed** for system Python 3.13 (`pip install anthropic --break-system-packages`) — needed by gateway for API-direct calls; was previously only available in uv-cached tool envs.

### 2026-05-20 (session 4)
- **Local ONNX embeddings**: `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` downloaded to `~/.code-index/models/`; `JCODEMUNCH_EMBED_MODEL=all-MiniLM-L6-v2` in `.env`; canary pinned; no API key required
- **install.sh step 4e**: `download-model` + `write_env_var` wired for all users/upgrades
- **auto-maintain.sh Part D**: downloads model if missing, pins canary if absent
- **healthcheck check 9l**: model present + env var set + canary pinned
- **jcodemunch scope fix**: unconditional `mcp remove -s local/project` after init eliminates uvx shadow
- **New skills**: `stack-not-at-head-remediation`, `telegram-gateway-security-audit`; `verify-handoff-claims` rewritten
- **HEALTHCHECK: ok** — all checks passing at close of session

### 2026-05-20 (session 3)
- **install.sh hardening**: `AUTO_REGISTER=1` default (was 0 — caused jcodemunch to stay at uvx path after every install); cron loop uses `install_cron` (remove-then-re-add, handles command updates); CLAUDE.md backup skips when unchanged; healthcheck removed from end of install (always false-failed before Claude restart); `feature-helpers.sh` sourced at top

### 2026-05-20 (session 2)
- **Auto-maintenance**: `scripts/auto-maintain.sh` + `scripts/jcodemunch-reindex.sh` created
- **Crons**: `uncle-j-jcodemunch-reindex` (1am), `uncle-j-auto-maintain` (3am) — registered and in install.sh
- **Post-merge hook**: now reindexes jcodemunch on `.py/.sh/.ts/.json/.toml` changes
- **Healthcheck**: 3 new guards — `check_jcodemunch_index_fresh` (9i), `check_untracked_skills` (9j), `check_auto_maintain_cron` (9k); `check_crons` expanded
- **Upgrade thresholds**: jcodemunch/jdatamunch/jdocmunch ≥20 commits behind HEAD, mempalace ≥5
- **HEALTHCHECK: ok** — all checks passing at close of session

## Priorities

### 1. No urgent items

**ECC agent import: done** ✅ — 6 specialist agents imported from ECC v2.0.0-rc.1:
`planner`, `code-reviewer`, `security-reviewer`, `architect`, `tdd-guide`, `silent-failure-hunter`

- Live in `global-agents/`, symlinked to `~/.claude/agents/` via `install-reliability.sh`
- `performance-optimizer` skipped — covered by jCodeMunch hotspot tools + code-reviewer
- `tdd-guide` patched: `npm test` → `pytest`, `npm run test:coverage` → `pytest --cov`
- Healthcheck guard: `check_agents()` in `healthcheck.sh`
- Full analysis: `docs/ecc-import-proposal.md`

### 2. No urgent items

Stack is clean and operational. Monitor:

```bash
# HNSW health
ls -lh ~/.mempalace/palace/*/link_lists.bin
# Should be near 0 bytes

# Package freshness (compares locked SHA vs GitHub HEAD)
bash scripts/check-stack-freshness.sh

# Full health
bash healthcheck.sh
```

### 2. Upgrade command (changed from previous sessions)

Packages are now git-sourced. Upgrade with:
```bash
uv lock --upgrade-package mempalace && uv sync --inexact
# repeat for jcodemunch, jdatamunch, jdocmunch as needed
```

### 3. MemPalace remote backup

Set `MEMPALACE_REMOTE` in `.env` and configure rclone if you want off-machine palace backups. See `README.md` section 13 for end-to-end setup.

## Operational notes

### MemPalace repair procedure (if HNSW corrupts again)

Use the one-shot script (handles FTS5 rebuild + HNSW delete + repair in the right order):
```bash
bash /opt/proj/Uncle-J-s-Refinery/mempalace-repair-now.sh
```

**Must be run when MCP server is not writing** — i.e., at the start of a fresh Claude session, before any mine jobs. The script pre-checks for active writers and aborts if found.

Manual steps (if script fails):
```bash
# 1. Kill any active mine jobs
ps aux | grep "mempalace mine" | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill 2>/dev/null

# 2. Rebuild FTS5
python3 -c "
import sqlite3
c = sqlite3.connect('$HOME/.mempalace/palace/chroma.sqlite3')
c.execute(\"INSERT INTO embedding_fulltext_search(embedding_fulltext_search) VALUES('rebuild')\")
c.commit()
print(c.execute('PRAGMA quick_check').fetchone()[0])
"

# 3. Delete HNSW binaries from active segments
for seg in 3a9d5d2b-2ccd-45c7-9bde-54bd7dc1a784 859be8a7-69ca-4409-81ab-4386a620320c; do
  rm -f ~/.mempalace/palace/$seg/{header,link_lists,data_level0}.bin
done

# 4. Rebuild
/opt/proj/Uncle-J-s-Refinery/.venv/bin/mempalace repair
```

### Mine lockfile cleanup (if mine process killed hard)

```bash
rmdir /opt/proj/Uncle-J-s-Refinery/state/mempalace-mine-convos.lock 2>/dev/null
rmdir /opt/proj/Uncle-J-s-Refinery/state/mempalace-mine-project.lock 2>/dev/null
```

### System baseline memory

This machine (`dtfd-xfce`, 14 GB RAM, 4 GB swap) runs clickhouse, next-server, Grafana, Loki, Minio, KDE plasma, and multiple Node workers as persistent services. Baseline RSS is ~3.5 GB. Swap should be 0 at rest.

### Push access

Remote is HTTPS (`https://github.com/williamblair333/Uncle-J-s-Refinery.git`). To push:
- Run `! gh auth login` in a Claude Code session, or
- Use a fine-scoped PAT as password on first HTTPS push

## Operational notes

### MemPalace health check

```bash
# Quick: confirm no crash
/opt/proj/Uncle-J-s-Refinery/.venv/bin/mempalace mine --dry-run \
  ~/.claude/projects --mode convos --wing conversations

# Check HNSW sizes
ls -lh ~/.mempalace/palace/*/link_lists.bin

# Check SQLite drawer count
python3 -c "
import sqlite3
c = sqlite3.connect(os.path.expanduser('~/.mempalace/palace/chroma.sqlite3'))
print(c.execute('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM embeddings').fetchone()[0], 'embeddings')
"
```

### Mine lockfiles

Lock directories live in `state/`. They are cleaned on normal exit via `trap`. If a mine process is killed hard (SIGKILL), the lock directory may be left behind. Clear manually:

```bash
rmdir /opt/proj/Uncle-J-s-Refinery/state/mempalace-mine-convos.lock 2>/dev/null
rmdir /opt/proj/Uncle-J-s-Refinery/state/mempalace-mine-project.lock 2>/dev/null
```

### System baseline memory

This machine (`dtfd-xfce`, 14 GB RAM, 4 GB swap) runs clickhouse, next-server, Grafana, Loki, Minio, KDE plasma, and multiple Node workers as persistent services. Baseline RSS is ~3.5 GB. `free -h` will always show `used: ~12 GB` because Linux counts page cache in `used`. Watch `available` and `swap used` — those are the real indicators. Swap should be 0 at rest.
